	1. Adding CONTROLLERS

Step 1 : Create a folder called Controller in the root directory of the project 
Step 2 : Create a class <ControllerName>Controller.cs inside the Controller directory
Step 3 : Add the MVC services to the Dependency Injection Container
	-- add services.AddMvc() in ConfigureServices()
Step 4 : Add MVC middleware to the Request Pipeline
	-- add app.UseMvcWithDefaultRoute() in Configure()

Step 2 : Then create model classes

	3.Adding VIEWS
	Adding view are not simple we need to a lot of care because name of view should match with controller
	for ex- All views of  HomeController should be places in Views/Home/
			EmployeeController should be places in Views/Employee/
So create folder accordingly
